# Changelog

What changed in each version of Silinx ISE. The newest version is first. Each section is also
the "What's new" text of its GitHub release.

## 15.9.3

- **Remove from Project keeps the file** in the project folder, as in ISE. The file leaves the
  project (hierarchy, compilation, simulation, synthesis) and is listed as *Not in project* in the
  Files view; right-click ▸ *Add to Project* brings it back.
- **Undo / Redo of Remove from Project**: the toolbar Undo / Redo buttons, *Edit ▸ Undo / Redo*
  and Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y (Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z on a Mac) outside an editor, and the *Undo* button of the
  message shown after removing.
- **Top-Level Source Type** in the New Project wizard: HDL, Schematic, State Machine (FSM),
  State Machine (ASM) or Truth Table. A non-HDL type starts the project with that document and its
  synchronized HDL module `top`.
- **Release notes**: this changelog; each GitHub release and the update dialog show what is new.
- Fixed: two project reloads close together could leave the older file list on screen.

## 15.9.2

- **Tri-state buffers** in the schematic library (category *Tri-State*): BUFE, BUFE4, BUFE8,
  BUFE16, BUFT, BUFT4, BUFT8, BUFT16. Several tri-state outputs and inout markers may share a bus;
  live simulation shows Z (blue) and conflicts (red); Symbol Info datasheets with Z in the truth table.
- Exported ISE schematics write tri-state buffers as Silinx symbols with their HDL (ISE's FPGA
  libraries have no BUFE/BUFT); checked with ISE 14.7 for Spartan-3E.

## 15.9.1

- New Source: *State Machine (FSM)* is listed before *State Machine (ASM)*.

## 15.9.0

- **State Machine (FSM) editor**: Moore and Mealy bubble diagrams with plain-language checks
  (unreachable states, overlapping or incomplete conditions), state / transition / encoded tables,
  truth tables of the next-state logic, a step-by-step simulation panel, and VHDL / Verilog kept in
  sync both ways; conversion to and from ASM charts.
- **Beginner-friendly messages and design checks**: every error keeps its ISE message, followed by
  an explanation and how to fix it (English and Portuguese); warnings for latches, missing
  sensitivity entries, two drivers, combinational loops, unused or unassigned signals, clock misuse
  and more. *Edit ▸ Design Checks* turns the warnings off; `-- silinx: ignore` silences one line.
- **Symbol Info**: a datasheet for every schematic symbol (description, pins, parameters, the
  truth / mode table, the equivalent VHDL and Verilog).
- **New Source reorganised**: Truth Table, Module (HDL), Module (Wizard), Schematic (Diagram),
  Schematic (Wizard), State Machines, Test Bench (HDL), Test Bench (Wizard), constraints, memory files.
- **Module Wizard** and **Schematic Wizard**: ports (inputs, outputs, inout), combinational or
  sequential templates with clock / reset, ready-placed I/O markers.
- **Inout ports** in the Module, Schematic and Test Bench wizards; Test Bench Wizard *No vectors*
  mode (a skeleton to write the stimulus yourself).
- No simulation top any more: *Simulate* runs the module selected in the Simulation view.
- Creating a file that already exists asks whether to replace it.
- *Implementation only* association in *Add Copy of Source*.
- The app checks for a newer release when it starts.
- Files are saved atomically (no half-written file after a crash).

## 15.8.0

- **Live schematic simulation** (like Logisim): *Simulate* in the schematic editor; click inputs,
  step or run clocks, wires coloured by their value, outputs and stored values shown.
- **Truth Table / Karnaugh Map tool**: tables of up to 6 inputs, K-maps with the groups drawn,
  minimal SOP / POS, canonical forms, a check of your own expression, and a linked VHDL / Verilog
  module kept in sync both ways; gate schematics generated from the table.
- I/O Pin Planning leaves the I/O standard at *default* unless one is chosen.

## 15.7.0

- **Test Bench Wizard**: self-checking test benches (exhaustive, random, counting, walking or typed
  vectors; expected values typed in or taken from the current design); every mismatch is reported,
  then TEST PASSED / TEST FAILED. The benches also run in Xilinx ISim.

## 15.6.1

- 1-bit vector ports are written as `x<0>` in the UCF; latch gates get global clock pins;
  schematic flip-flops with unconnected CLR / CE generate valid HDL; Files view can rename and
  delete folders.

## 15.6.0

- Many simulator fixes and additions found by a large new test suite (VHDL records, 2-D arrays,
  overloading, case-generate; Verilog macros with arguments, `include`, defparam, named events …).
- Netlists from the real ISE 14.7 are checked against their RTL for 13 designs.
- The board emulator no longer jumps up and down (seen on Safari); knob turns are never lost.
- About and README: Silinx ISE was developed to support the teaching of Digital Systems at
  FCT NOVA, because AMD/Xilinx discontinued Xilinx ISE.

## 15.5.0

- **Board emulator**: run the design on a drawing of the real board (Basys2, Nexys2, Spartan-3E
  Starter Kit with its LCD and rotary knob); the timing of slow designs is scaled so they visibly run.
- **Netlist simulation**: simulate and emulate the post-synthesis, post-translate, post-map and
  post-place & route models from ISE; technology schematic, timing, power and pin reports.
- DCMs synthesize their real output frequencies; many more Xilinx primitive models.
- A full audit: fixes in the simulator, schematics, ASM charts, UCF handling, server and web UI.

## 15.4.0

- *Help ▸ Check for Updates*; About shows the GitHub project and the developers.
- *Add Copy of Source* only (Add Source removed); New Source left the File menu.

## 15.3.0

- Import / Export of Silinx ISE projects and of Xilinx ISE projects (.zip).
- ASM charts: case (multi-way) boxes and bit / slice conditions; printing and Save PNG.
- Processes panel with ISE-style expand / collapse that remembers its state.

## 15.2.4

- RTL schematic: *Up* and *Push into* buttons.

## 15.2.3

- Distribution files renamed: `Silinx-ISE.html`, `silinx-ise-<version>.zip`.

## 15.2.2

- Maintenance release.

## 15.2.1

- Schematic and ASM editors: Backspace deletes the selection again (as Delete).

## 15.2.0

- The project is renamed **Silinx ISE** (it was XAIlinx ISE).

## 15.1.0

- Schematic editor: T and JK flip-flops, the full D flip-flop family, inverted-input gates,
  decoders, encoders, demultiplexers; moving components keeps their connections.
- The version is shown in the title bar.

## 15.0.2

- ASM charts: registers power up with their reset values.

## 15.0.1

- Window titles without the version number.

## 15.0.0

- Version numbering in the style of ISE (15.x); the project is called *XAIlinx ISE*.

## 0.3.0

- Beginner-friendly start: double-click launchers and a step-by-step guide.

## 0.2.0

- README: download section.

## 0.1.0

- First release: ISE-style projects with VHDL / Verilog, a syntax-checking editor, the schematic
  editor and ASM state-machine charts kept in sync with HDL, ISE schematic import / export,
  behavioural simulation with waveforms, Xilinx ISE 14.7 implementation (Docker / local / ssh),
  UCF checks, ISE project import, English and Portuguese interface.
